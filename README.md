# Angular Spotify

Currently a WIP

Features currently implemented so far:

1. Able to play full length tracks through Spotify's playback sdk
2. The use of graphQL and angular-apollo to reduce response sizes from spotify APIs

# Running the project locally

To run the project use `npm start`

Also need to make sure that the [GraphQL Server](https://github.com/mrgardner/AngularSpotify-GraphQL-Server) is running.

# Testing

For unit tests use `npm run test`
For e2e tests use `npm run e2e`

# Linting

Use `npm run lint`
